According to our results, this method mixing planes and keypoints matching leads to better results in this project. Indeed this method obtains the smallest error in translation over all the methods tested. For the rotation part, plane matching is performing as good as the mixed method in average (even slightly better but not significantly) but has a larger standard deviation. 
From these measures we can clearly see that matching methods (keypoints, planes and mixed) perform a lot better on this registration problem than ICP methods,
